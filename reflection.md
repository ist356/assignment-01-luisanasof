## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

#What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle?Where might you need more practice?

Experience:

Overall, I thought this was the right amount of challenging for a first assignment. My main struggles had more to do with navigating visual studio code and the extensions rather than figuring out how to write the code itself. 

Recalled from class:
Before starting the assignment, I reviewed the slides from class and made notes of important information/tips that I thought would aid my understanding of each concept.  
When writing the numbers.py challenge, I found it helpful to write myself a note with what class concepts the problem was incorporating so that 1. I had an idea of what the code was going to look like and 2. I had them as a reference while writing the final code. 

Learned: 

- How to build dictionaries and how they work (ie how to iniate them and append them, the fact that key-value pairs are unique unless the value is a list)
- Practiced indefinite loops, list/dict methods, relational operators

Next steps/ more practice: 

As I mentioned, I definitely still need more practice with visual studio code itself and learning how it's used + better understanding the "jargon" or some of the terms/tools/ functions etc I am unfamilar with -- for ex, more broadly, learning how to use the terminal as well as the other tabs. 

For the material covered in this assignment, I definitely need more practice with debugging. I did not understand how the code line breaking and "stepping over" helped with finding bugs or what their functions were.   

Would also like to better learn how to read test results.
